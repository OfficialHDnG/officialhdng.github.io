							<h1>I of IV</h1>
							<p><span style="color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;">Ea lives alone with her young sister, Nyeve. Nyeve is a young adult who often does not come home. Yet now, Nyeve has gone missing for many days.</span></p>
							<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0.5em; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Before Nyeve&rsquo;s disappearance, a mysterious boy,&nbsp;<a href="e1.html#shone" style="text-decoration: none; color: white; background: none;" title="Shone">Shone</a>, sets up a meeting with Ea.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">After the meeting Shone texts Ea saying: &ldquo;I know your sister has gone missing&rdquo;. At first Ea does not believe him, because Nyeve is rarely home.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Then, Ea fails to contact Nyeve for the next few days.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Everything Shone has done, including the meeting, seems to be setting up an alibi - or luring Ea out of her home so something could be done to Nyeve. However, Nyeve was not home during the day when Ea went to meet Shone.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Nyeve disappears for many days while Ea searches desperately, and one day, Shone texts Ea again, telling her the concept of &ldquo;<strong><a href="e1.html#shone" style="text-decoration: none; color: white; background: none;" title="Shone">Zeata</a></strong>&rdquo;. Using the concept of &ldquo;Zeata&rdquo;, and predicting the &ldquo;Zeata&rdquo; of any criminal who could have harmed Nyeve, Ea successfully captures 3 men who kidnapped Nyeve. Shone was not one of them.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Nyeve was found, having passed away, with evidence of several weeks of abuse.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">In the law court, Ea says she wants to release the 3 men. The 3 men are released as innocent.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">To the outside world, Ea says she has learned to forgive.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Ea undergoes cosmetic surgery to look different. She renovates her entire home. Nyeve is not home any more; Ea needs her home to look different.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Ea starts studying to become a veterinarian.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Ea changes her name.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">To the few people who knew of Ea&apos;s existence, they knew Ea was taking positive steps to recovering from Nyeve&apos;s death.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">But Nyeve&apos;s death involved several weeks of abuse.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">________________________________________________________________</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">In her mind, Ea cannot accept the fact that the 3 men who cruelly kidnapped and murdered her sister can just live a care-free prison life. The 3 men like to hurt women. Ea knew that. Ea knew this was part of the 3 men&apos;s Zeata. With another &quot;hacking&apos; of the Zeata, Ea successfully recaptures them again by herself.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Ea sets up an experiment, in which the 3 men&rsquo;s cruel natures end up helping Ea take revenge. Ea does not hurt any one of the men to avenge her sister; the men do that themselves, in Ea&rsquo;s experiment. Ea, instead, turns into a caregiver who feeds and provides care for the three men. Yet the three men&rsquo;s abusive behavior never ends, and Ea becomes mentally unable to continue.&nbsp;<a href="e1.html#ea" style="text-decoration: none; color: white; background: none;" title="Main Page">Ea unlocks her GLYPTIC: The Utopian Fragility.</a></p>

On top of a 200+ floor building, Ea jumps off.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">In her mind, Ea is wondering: why would a mysterious stranger know Nyeve has gone missing? If the mysterious stranger could provide a hint, to help her capture the kidnappers of her sister, why has the mysterious stranger not done so himself? Did the mysterious stranger know all the cruel things done to Nyeve?</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">These questions run through her mind, as Ea falls from the top of her building.</p>

Ea is still in Shone arms. Shone&rsquo;s eyes are only looking into the distance, waiting for something. Then, Shone falls asleep. &nbsp;</p>

The cages in Ea&apos;s home are not prepared for animals who needed to become healthy again. Or, are they? No matter what the answer was, Ea&rsquo;s plan was a success: she has captured Shone. &nbsp;</p>

How did you know Nyeve was missing, even before me? I am the sister who lives with Nyeve - and who are you? Next, how did you know the way to capture the 3 kidnappers? You knew so well, that you could even teach me how to do it. &nbsp;Did you...did you know what they did to Nyeve? And my biggest question is, how were you able to stand on the side and know all these things done to Nyeve, while not stopping all these things from happening to her? Over a month Shone. Nyeve was abused. Shone, please tell me you are innocent. But I don&apos;t know if you are.</p>

In fact, I don&rsquo;t even know you. I met you once. But what I do know is, whoever you are, you have something you want from me. You were perhaps monitoring Nyeve, to know her disappearance. You were perhaps monitoring me, to text me about how to capture the kidnappers. And so, if there is something you want from me, I am the only thing in your Zeata that I could use. I was willing to bet my life, in order for you to appear. If you came tonight to save me from the fall, I would have the answers I have been wanting...for so many days and nights Shone, I have been wanting them. If you did not come tonight to save me from the fall, life does not mean much to me any more now that Nyeve is gone. &nbsp;The three men will never stop. But I was right Shone. You want something from me, so you could not let me die. Now Shone, I want something from you. Shone: your answers, please.</p>

The sunlight is golden. The sun shines on the green plants Ea took care of, to make the slum skyscraper a little more beautiful for her neighbors. Everything that happened last night: jumping off the building, seeing Shone, and questioning Shone seemed like a dream. Right now, in Ea&rsquo;s mind, all she wants is to buy a cup of coffee. She wants a cup of coffee from a specific little shop in their skyscraper. It is a low-quality shop, and the coffee is bad, but it is something Ea and Nyeve could afford one cup of when either of them had a birthday. It is no one&rsquo;s birthday today, but Ea wanted to get a cup. Ea doesn&rsquo;t even want to drink it; maybe just seeing it will be enough.</p>

							<h1>III of IV</h1>
							<p>Beside Shone, sitting in a wheel chair, Nyeve has a reddish wound on the bottom right side of her face. But that is all. Nyeve is alive and well. Ea hears Nyeve&rsquo;s voice talking to her. But Nyeve&rsquo;s lips are not moving. Nyeve only looks at Ea. Tears run from Ea&apos;s eyes, but Ea could not manage to say a word. &ldquo;Ea, I&rsquo;m alive. Remember one of those times, I left home for two months, and I came back telling you I married a gangster in another country and divorced him? That story is only half true. He did some things to me, and left me in the city&rsquo;s dark corners to die. Close to my death, a young child and an old lady appeared in front of me. They took me to a place, a beautiful place that seemed to be unreal. There, the sky, mountains, and waters shine. There is no city, almost no trace of humans. The plants and animals were new, many I&rsquo;ve never seen before. And when you did see a human, they were 7 times our size. They talked, li</p>
							<p>ke this: they talked with their mind. They did not need to talk with sound. Because when they talk with spoken words, terrible things happened. They were able to create entire worlds with their voice. I lived with them, and they did not heal me: the air, water, the natural world itself healed all my wounds. I lived with these titans, in a strange beautiful world, thinking it was a dream, or was it heaven? It was an afterlife I did not think I deserve. Then, I learned how to speak their language.&rdquo; Nyeve stops her message to Ea. Suddenly, Nyeve&rsquo;s lips move. Nyeve is whispering in a language, a language Ea has never heard before. Outside, the bright blue sky flashes. Lightning strikes. For the next few minutes, the blue sky is broken by lightning and thunderous roars as Nyeve continues speaking in the strange language. Nyeve uses her mind to talk to Ea&rsquo;s mind once again. &ldquo;Everyone has special powers, Ea. The power I gained is the power of electrons and lightning. This is my power with their their language. Ea, one day, I came back to our world. I asked the child if I could come back, when I realized I was not in an afterlife: I was in a different region of our world. The child nodded, and brought me back. I returned from the skies, wet from head to toe. I returned, because I knew, my powers to control electrons and lightning can do much more here. In that amazing, dream-like world, I was weak, and my powers were nothing compared to the Titans; to me, they were like angels - their powers were supernatural compared to mine. And they were angels to me. They did everything to make me feel like I am their family. Yet, in our world, I can be much more. I used my powers I gained from the other world to hunt down the men who hurt me. Ea, you know the type of people and social-circles I used to be in. It is a dark, dark part of humanity. Yet, when I started researching the backgrounds of the men who hurt me, wanting to take revenge on them, I realized that many of them have been hurt before. They were hurt by other people, other gangs, other groups when they were growing up. So I kept going. I kept on doing what I thought was justice. I hunted down men who hurt those men. I hunted down more men who hurt more men. I took over entire organizations. I took over their operations. Very soon, Ea, I found myself on top of the biggest criminal organizations in the City. One nation by one nation. I took over their wealth. One by one. No one could stand in front of my powers. With a few whispers to disrupt the electrons in their hearts or brains, very few could stand. Organized crime exists in our world still, but I am its queen. In the dark, I control who has a chance to hurt someone else. And if they do try to hurt any one, I take them down. Erasing organized crime from the world is impossible; the moment I give up my throne, someone else will take my throne in the world of organized crime. The abolishment of organized crime requires everyone involved in it to make a unanimous decision to quit. If one person wants to gain any sort of power from organized crime, when I die, they will take over. Organized crime, therefore, will always exist in humanity. I will let crime exist, but under my conditions. With the money I gained from all the organized criminal operations, I have tremendous power over what happens in the darkest corners of society. Ea, the only good news I can bring you today is not that I am alive, but that I have been able to prevent some pain, suffering, and oppression. With my powers, anyone who wants to create pain, suffering, or oppression to others will have to bow before me. I was so successful in preventing unnecessary organized crimes, that I turned my eyes to taking care of spontaneous crime. Unexpected murders, robberies, and rapes...these were things that I could not help prevent, until I met Shone. When I met Shone, he was the son of a victim. Shone had no will to live, and the only thing he wanted was to see his father again, even if the father was only brought back to life as an android. With Shone&rsquo;s total dedication, and the powers I gained from the other world, we &ldquo;revived&rdquo; his father as an android easily. We revived many more dead bodies as androids, making them look weak and easy to take advantage of. We use them to bait criminals of our City. The City is still full of criminals, you would know that Ea. Maybe that is why you fear leaving our home. Yet to a criminal, the most irresistable crime is an easy target. This is where our androids come in - they are weak, they are frail, and they are defenseless compared to a real human being. Our androids satisfy the desires of criminals who commit spontaneous crimes. Then, our androids alert our agents to capture these criminals. No matter how bad the androids are damaged in a crime, we just repair them - it is as easy as sewing clothes. The criminals we captured, the very worst ones, we turned into more androids. They become more bait to help fish out more criminals. For a long time now, Ea, almost all of the reported crime on the news you can find is committed on our androids. No real humans were hurt. Our androids fill that role. Our androids are designed to satisfy human desires. With this success, can I turn my eyes to domestic crime that happens in the family? Can I continue, to reduce pain and crime from our world? That is when I realized, I am so limited Ea. There are so many people whose pain I cannot even touch. At one point in our operations...I caught the cancer in the Wild. Illness - what a simple, common concept it is. As simple as it is, I am helpless against it. Ea, this is why Shone and I have lied to you. I am kept in cryogenesis, to help slow the progression of the illness. I only come out of cryogenesis, to go home to you. In front of you, I would act like the same drug-addict that I was growing up. I did not want you to know why I was missing for so many days. I did not want you to be involved in any of our operations, in case I could not protect you against my enemies. My enemies are everywhere Ea. Just based on the amount of wealth I have alone, I would have people looking to take me down. I cannot have anything bad happen to you, because of me. The world of organized crime is not kind to a kind soul like you. So I kept everything a secret from you. In front of you, I was still the same horrible sister I was in our youth. Yet, at home, you would still love me whenever I returned. Seeing you love me, despite me being a useless person, gave me a lot of strength. But Ea, the time has changed. I am in cryogenesis so often, that our crime-prevention operations is beginning to falter. We need someone, like me: someone who is not afraid to do anything. Even jump off a building, if it achieves her goals. Shone and I have set all this up. I knew you are my gentle sister; for my whole life, I knew that. The only way to turn you into the monster we need - the only way to turn you into a monster like me, for the crime-prevention operation, is by faking my death. Ea, you are better than me. You always were. Whatever you set your mind to, you accomplish. The fear of seeing the 3 men victimize other women, is your only one motivation to keep them locked in your cages. It is the only reason why your experiment never ends Ea - because you don&apos;t want to kill them, yet you cannot release them. Their abusive motivations, and all the torment you see everyday shatters your heart so much, but you will let your heart be shattered every single day if it means they are not doing this to innocent victims. Ea, to protect victims, your Zeata is almost unbreakable. Your Zeata is justice. But your Zeata has one flaw. In your sleep, I whispered to you that I wanted a cup of coffee we used to have as children. And you woke up, with nothing but coffee on your mind. I am the flaw in your Zeata; it is easy to control your actions, if the enemy has me. But do not worry Ea, because I will be gone soon. The sickness of the Wild is strong. I am not stronger than it. But Ea, I know you are stronger than me. For my dreams, I betray you. Can you help my dream live on, Ea?&rdquo; Suddenly, Nyeve&rsquo;s message stops. Her lips stop moving, and Nyeve looks outside. The lightning and thunder cease. The sky is calm now. Shone presses a button on the wheelchair. Nyeve falls asleep. Shone turns to Ea and holds her wrist. Shone says to Ea: &ldquo;please follow me, and follow me close.&rdquo; Shone takes Ea and Nyeve on an extremely complicated route. Many times, the three of them loop back to the same point. But they are walking fast, almost running. Shone explains to Ea: &ldquo;Ea, sorry we lied to you. But we did not lie about one thing: the three men did do all those things to another innocent girl. The pain you have experienced, is the real pain of another family. The three men did those things prior to Nyeve&apos;s return from Yemog. They were released from prison without a death penalty. It is why they are our androids now, and even as androids, if the software we implant into their minds is left inactive, their desire to abuse others resurface. They don&apos;t eat, because they are half-robots, Ea. Now I have something more important to tell you.&quot; Shone looks at Ea with very earnest eyes. &quot;After one complex mission, Ea, Nyeve needs to involve you in another mission. Nyeve&apos;s lightning and thunder, shattering a blue sunny sky has no other purpose than to draw the attention of other Yemogs - other humans who have had Nyeve&rsquo;s experience. They are those who have possibly also been taken up to the world above, and gained terrifying powers just like Nyeve. When Nyeve first realized there might be other humans with her powers, she was excited to find allies. But her excitement quickly turned into disgust, when she realized no one was a partner; all are in hiding, and all potentially running their own operations that we do not know about. We don&rsquo;t know exactly who they are. What we do know, is that it is hard to fish them out into the public eye. Most importantly, none of them have an interest in solving the problem of crime. These are not friends, Ea. They are people who hold immense powers in their hands, but were able to turn a blind eye. They lived their own lives, watching the cancer turn into the entire region known as the Wild. They lived their own lives, watching the City fall into unbelievable crime rates that would shock citizens in the darkest movies. One of the strongest, and most publicly-known suspected-Yemog, Elronde, lives openly as a semi-deity on television. These are not friends; they would rather use their powers to live as gods among humans, rather than help with any human problems. With you as our new leader, we need to know exactly who the Yemogs are, and how many Yemogs are there. Ea, unlike Nyeve, you do not have any powers as a Yemog. Nyeve used all her energy now to call upon roughly 1700 bolts of lightning to do one thing. Nyeve is creating an illusion that a new Yemog has just returned to our world. She is creating the illusion that there is a new Yemog with tremendous powers. And that the new Yemog is so inexperienced, that they do not understand power should be kept hidden, in order to achieve long-term goals in our world. This illusion is the exact opposite to the truth: the new leader, you, has zero powers, and our ex-leader, Nyeve, is a cancer patient, resting in cryogenesis in the closet of a 1-bedroom apartment. Run with me Ea. Every pedestrian and passenger you see right now is either someone Nyeve has known for years in your building, or one of our androids. And our androids are picking up signals of outsiders, coming close to this part of the City, to analyze the source of the 1700 lightning strikes. It is what we want: we want to fish them out to investigate. But for now, we cannot let a single outsider see you, see me, or see Nyeve in this wheelchair. So follow me, and follow me close.&ldquo; After an hour, the three of them arrive in another skyscraper, which normally will only need a three-minute train ride from home. Shone puts Nyeve to rest in Nyeve&rsquo;s closet. Shone turns to Ea and says: &ldquo;Ea, my leader. The ten thousand androids in Nyeve&apos;s command are yours. Her wealth is yours. And my life, is yours.&rdquo;</p>

That story is only half true. He did some things to me, and left me in the city&rsquo;s dark corners to die. Close to my death, a young child and an old lady appeared in front of me. They took me to a place, a beautiful place that seemed to be unreal. There, the sky, mountains, and waters shine. There is no city, almost no trace of humans. The plants and animals were new, many I&rsquo;ve never seen before. And when you did see a human, they were 7 times our size. They talked, like this: they talked with their mind. They did not need to talk with sound.</p>

I lived with these titans, in a strange beautiful world, thinking it was a dream, or was it heaven? It was an afterlife I did not think I deserve.</p>

Suddenly, Nyeve&rsquo;s lips move. Nyeve is whispering in a language, a language Ea has never heard before.</p>

Lightning strikes. For the next few minutes, the blue sky is broken by lightning and thunderous roars as Nyeve continues speaking in the strange language.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Nyeve uses her mind to talk to Ea&rsquo;s mind once again. &ldquo;Everyone has special powers, Ea. The power I gained is the power of electrons and lightning. This is my power with their their language.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Ea, one day, I came back to our world. I asked the child if I could come back, when I realized I was not in an afterlife: I was in a different region of our&nbsp;<a href="e0.html#ri" style="text-decoration: none; color: white; background: none;" title="Ri">world</a>. The child nodded, and brought me back. I returned from the skies, wet from head to toe. I returned, because I knew, my powers to control electrons and lightning can do much more here. In that amazing, dream-like world, I was weak, and my powers were nothing compared to the Titans; to me, they were like angels - their powers were supernatural compared to mine. And they were angels to me. They did everything to make me feel like I am their family.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Yet, in our world, I can be much more.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">I used my powers I gained from the other world to hunt down the men who hurt me. Ea, you know the type of people and social-circles I used to be in. It is a dark, dark part of humanity. Yet, when I started researching the backgrounds of the men who hurt me, wanting to take revenge on them, I realized that many of them have been hurt before. They were hurt by other people, other gangs, other groups when they were growing up. So I kept going. I kept on doing what I thought was justice. I hunted down men who hurt those men. I hunted down more men who hurt more men. I took over entire organizations. I took over their operations. Very soon, Ea, I found myself on top of the biggest criminal organizations in the City. One nation by one nation. I took over their wealth. One by one. No one could stand in front of my powers. With a few whispers to disrupt the electrons in their hearts or brains, very few could stand.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Organized crime exists in our world still, but I am its queen. In the dark, I control who has a chance to hurt someone else. And if they do try to hurt any one, I take them down. Erasing organized crime from the world is impossible; the moment I give up my throne, someone else will take my throne in the world of organized crime. The abolishment of organized crime requires everyone involved in it to make a unanimous decision to quit. If one person wants to gain any sort of power from organized crime, when I die, they will take over. Organized crime, therefore, will always exist in humanity.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">I will let crime exist, but under my conditions.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">With the money I gained from all the organized criminal operations, I have tremendous power over what happens in the darkest corners of society. Ea, the only good news I can bring you today is not that I am alive, but that I have been able to prevent some pain, suffering, and oppression. With my powers, anyone who wants to create pain, suffering, or oppression to others will have to bow before me.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">I was so successful in preventing unnecessary organized crimes, that I turned my eyes to taking care of spontaneous crime. Unexpected murders, robberies, and rapes...these were things that I could not help prevent, until I met Shone.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">When I met Shone, he was the son of a victim. Shone had no will to live, and the only thing he wanted was to see his father again, even if the father was only brought back to life as an android. With Shone&rsquo;s total dedication, and the powers I gained from the other world, we &ldquo;revived&rdquo; his father as an android easily. We revived many more dead bodies as androids, making them look weak and easy to take advantage of. We use them to bait criminals of our City.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">The City is still full of criminals, you would know that Ea. Maybe that is why you fear leaving our home.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Yet to a criminal, the most irresistable crime is an easy target. This is where our androids come in - they are weak, they are frail, and they are defenseless compared to a real human being. Our androids satisfy the desires of criminals who commit spontaneous crimes.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Then, our androids alert our agents to capture these criminals. No matter how bad the androids are damaged in a crime, we just repair them - it is as easy as sewing clothes.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">The criminals we captured, the very worst ones, we turned into more androids. They become more bait to help fish out more criminals. For a long time now, Ea, almost all of the reported crime on the news you can find is committed on our androids. No real humans were hurt. Our androids fill that role. Our androids are designed to satisfy human desires.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">With this success, can I turn my eyes to domestic crime that happens in the family? Can I continue, to reduce pain and crime from our world? That is when I realized, I am so limited Ea. There are so many people whose pain I cannot even touch. At one point in our operations...I caught the cancer in the Wild.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Illness - what a simple, common concept it is. As simple as it is, I am helpless against it.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Ea, this is why Shone and I have lied to you.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">I am kept in cryogenesis, to help slow the progression of the illness. I only come out of cryogenesis, to go home to you. In front of you, I would act like the same drug-addict that I was growing up. I did not want you to know why I was missing for so many days. I did not want you to be involved in any of our operations, in case I could not protect you against my enemies. My enemies are everywhere Ea. Just based on the amount of wealth I have alone, I would have people looking to take me down. I cannot have anything bad happen to you, because of me. The world of organized crime is not kind to a kind soul like you.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">So I kept everything a secret from you. In front of you, I was still the same horrible sister I was in our youth. Yet, at home, you would still love me whenever I returned.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Seeing you love me, despite me being a useless person, gave me a lot of strength.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">But Ea, the time has changed. I am in cryogenesis so often, that our crime-prevention operations is beginning to falter. We need someone, like me: someone who is not afraid to do anything. Even jump off a building, if it achieves her goals.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Shone and I have set all this up. I knew you are my gentle sister; for my whole life, I knew that. The only way to turn you into the monster we need - the only way to turn you into a monster like me, for the crime-prevention operation, is by faking my death. Ea, you are better than me. You always were. Whatever you set your mind to, you accomplish. The fear of seeing the 3 men victimize other women, is your only one motivation to keep them locked in your cages. It is the only reason why your experiment never ends Ea - because you don&apos;t want to kill them, yet you cannot release them. Their abusive motivations, and all the torment you see everyday shatters your heart so much, but you will let your heart be shattered every single day if it means they are not doing this to innocent victims.</p>

In your sleep, I whispered to you that I wanted a cup of coffee we used to have as children. And you woke up, with nothing but coffee on your mind. I am the flaw in your Zeata; it is easy to control your actions, if the enemy has me.</p>

Nyeve&apos;s lightning and thunder, shattering a blue sunny sky has no other purpose than to draw the attention of other Yemogs - other humans who have had Nyeve&rsquo;s experience. They are those who have possibly also been taken up to the world above, and gained terrifying powers just like Nyeve. When Nyeve first realized there might be other humans with her powers, she was excited to find allies. But her excitement quickly turned into disgust, when she realized no one was a partner; all are in hiding, and all potentially running their own operations that we do not know about. We don&rsquo;t know exactly who they are. What we do know, is that it is hard to fish them out into the public eye. Most importantly, none of them have an interest in solving the problem of crime.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">These are not friends, Ea. They are people who hold immense powers in their hands, but were able to turn a blind eye. They lived their own lives, watching the cancer turn into the entire region known as the Wild. They lived their own lives, watching the City fall into unbelievable crime rates that would shock citizens in the darkest movies. One of the strongest, and most publicly-known suspected-Yemog, Elronde, lives openly as a semi-deity on television. These are not friends; they would rather use their powers to live as gods among humans, rather than help with any human problems.</p>

Ea, unlike Nyeve, you do not have any powers as a Yemog. Nyeve used all her energy now to call upon roughly 1700 bolts of lightning to do one thing. Nyeve is creating an illusion that a new Yemog has just returned to our world. She is creating the illusion that there is a new Yemog with tremendous powers. And that the new Yemog is so inexperienced, that they do not understand power should be kept hidden, in order to achieve long-term goals in our world.</p>

							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Run with me Ea. Every pedestrian and passenger you see right now is either someone Nyeve has known for years in your building, or one of our androids. And our androids are picking up signals of outsiders, coming close to this part of the City, to analyze the source of the 1700 lightning strikes. It is what we want: we want to fish them out to investigate. But for now, we cannot let a single outsider see you, see me, or see Nyeve in this wheelchair. So follow me, and follow me close.&ldquo;</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">After an hour, the three of them arrive in another skyscraper, which normally will only need a three-minute train ride from home.

After the phasing out of Ri&rsquo;s traditional religions called &ldquo;The Antiquity&rdquo;, a thousand different cults blossomed. Over the years, the new religions have died, merged, and stabilized to roughly ten religions.</span></p>
							<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0.5em; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Among the religious leaders is Elronde, the mastermind behind concentrating all of humanity&rsquo;s architecture into hyper-condensed skyscrapers. As the architect of the Pinnacle of Man-Kings, Elronde is hailed as one of humanity&rsquo;s greatest pioneers who helped control the CTVT of the Wild. But in recent years, his entire life has been devoted to re-structuring his public image as a deity of his own religion.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Elronde is both the leader and self-proclaimed god of the fourth largest religion in Ri.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Elronde releases a statement on the &ldquo;Blue Lightning&rdquo; incident in the sector-43 skyscrapers.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Elronde claims that the unusual, 7-minute long lightning phenomenon is a spiritual blessing, and that anyone who has directly witnessed the event with their eyes (not through a video or television) has been blessed. Elronde invites all eyewitnesses to a three-day spiritual event at his 11th largest skyscraper he owns as a religious leader: é»ç° &middot; íì¼ Temple. Elronde says the three-day event will help him identify the next leaders of his religion, and he offers a tremendous salary to the ten leaders he will select from the spiritual event.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Long suspected as a Yemog, Elronde and his religion is one part of Ri&apos;s society that Nyeve and Shone has been monitoring. Aside from eye witnesses of Elronde being able to control human limbs of his followers to physically worship him (clapping, waving, bowing), there are no other indications of Elronde&rsquo;s power from the world above. Elronde&rsquo;s rise to fame, and the source of his immense wealth comes from being the architect of some of the world&rsquo;s most hyper-condensed skyscrapers (combining shopping malls, public pools, libraries, and offices with homes in the same building, to drastically reduce travel time, travel cost, and energy expenditure at a national level; in Ri, some smaller nations are condensed in merely 10~20 mega skyscrapers). His concept of a hyper-condensed skyscraper is not unique to him, yet he rose to power when the spread of CTVT forced humanity to give up entire neighborhoods to be infected by the transmissible cancer. All nations switched to the hyper-condensed skyscraper model. Elronde&rsquo;s towers also stood the test of time, as they often remain as the only standing or undamaged towers after some of the most recent earthquakes in Ri.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Nyeve and Shone&rsquo;s greatest suspicion lies in that Elronde has somehow engineered, or encouraged the spread of CTVT, in order for all nations in Ri to immediately turn to hyper-condensed skyscrapers as the default mode of human habitats. During one of Nyeve&rsquo;s research operations into the Wild, Nyeve catches the disease.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">With the announcement on the &ldquo;Blue Lightning&rdquo; incident, Elronde remains Nyeve and Shone&rsquo;s number one suspect for a Yemog.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Shone explains to Ea: &ldquo;Nyeve gained tremendous mental-functioning when she returned from the land above. Nyeve claims that nature, pure, clean, and completely free from human interference, was able to unlock the hidden abilities in her brain. I did not believe her. But I did not need to believe her. I taught Nyeve how to program Androids. Within a few days, she was programming at a speed a thousand Shone&rsquo;s can program as a team.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Elronde here has just devised a strategy that helps fish out any Yemogs, or any one working for a Yemog like me. First, he&rsquo;s trying to draw the attention of anyone who was close to me, you, and Nyeve that day, because he&rsquo;s inviting all eye-witnesses. Secondly, by doing an open invitation, even other Yemogs who were not present at the Blue Lightning event would be interested in what kind of crowd responds to Elronde&rsquo;s invitation. Thirdly, by offering an attractive salary, Elronde is also inviting a bunch of idiots who will pretend to be eyewitnesses just so they can earn the leadership position. Separating these idiots from any Yemogs, if any Yemogs show up to Elronde&rsquo;s invitation, is too easy.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Nyeve is one. Elronde is two. If there is a third Yemog, I cannot imagine a reason why a third Yemog would avoid Elronde&apos;s event.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">This is such a well-crafted strategy, that I am almost surprised no other Yemog has made a similar announcement. None of the other major religions have released an official statement similar to this one. If other religions are also run by Yemogs, I am expecting them to follow Elronde to make similar invitations - or, attend Elronde&apos;s event themselves.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">With one single action, Elronde has turned our plan, into his plan. Nyeve and I have the audio and video-footage, captured by eye-monitors of 300 androids recording any outsiders during yesterday lightning period. We are still analyzing these recordings with more androids and agents. Elronde now has set up a three-day event where all of these people can be examined by him in person. Ea: this is the level of strategy and deception we can expect from enemies of Nyeve. This is why Nyeve has never wanted to involve you in her operations.&rdquo;</p>

							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Ea argues with Shone that she will have to face a Yemog eventually, and because she is not a Yemog, Elronde should not have any reason to focus on Ea. &ldquo;Just yesterday, I was a regular orphaned girl in the slums, Shone.&rdquo; Ea says.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Shone is not convinced, but Ea finally convinces Shone:</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">&ldquo;Watch over me, like you watch over Nyeve. You are the programmer and hivemind of the Androids. Let your 10,000 androids guard me Shone.</p>

							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Shone prepares a team of twenty-five androids, fully dressed as humans, to arrive at different times for Elronde&rsquo;s event. Shone also has prepared the androids in various combinations of human and machine, in order to assess if any of Elronde&rsquo;s videos of Elronde controlling human limbs is true. Ea is connected to Shone in the headquarters with an ear piece: a single whisper and breath from Ea would be heard by Shone miles away. Androids are scheduled to have eyes on Ea the whole time, providing a video feed to Shone with varying angles.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Ea arrives, and quickly understands what Shone is saying. Almost everyone arrives, following every single rule, attempting to put on their best show to please Elronde&rsquo;s many monks, followers, and employees at the Temple. Ea knows her job: follow. Blend into the crowd. She tries to please everyone, attempting to be like the others around her who are trying hard to win a salary.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Ea&rsquo;s eyes, however, are on the people who aren&rsquo;t following the rules. There are obvious ones who stand out against the crowd. These are individuals who do not seem eager to please Elronde in any form.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">But even more so, there are those that simply fade into the background. They are neither pleasing Elronde, nor making it obvious that they are not interested in pleasing Elronde. They achieve the task of simply being there, but letting no one else feel their existence.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Ea looks, at all times, for those who manage to catch no attention. She is trying to find experts at blending in.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">A tall girl: Ea has noticed her ability to fade into the crowd many times now.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Ea communicates to Shone, to monitor that specific girl more closely with the 25 androids.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Shone is able to use one of the twenty-five androids to get a DNA sample of the girl left on the side of the many escalators in the Temple. Shone matches the sample to government databases, and many other private sources of information that Nyeve has access to.</p>
							<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px 0px; color: white; font-family: "Times new Roman", serif; font-size: 16x; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Shone sees the name displayed after a confirmed match.</p>
