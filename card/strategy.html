						<strong>GoldenAge, the Child:</strong>  GoldenAge allows another member or enemy to take 1 LoreSong he owns
						</br>
						<strong>X, the Mystery:</strong>  X can return a LoreSong to force an enemy to return a LoreSong with him - the side which returns a more mysterious LoreSong deals massive damage to the other

							You can also finish your turn by pressing ‘Fin’ Button on the left
						</br>	</br>
							Saving - at the end of each turn, you can save a maximum of 4 LoreSongs. All LoreSongs beyond number 4 will be returned 
						</br>	</br>
							AUTO lets an android automatically choose LoreSongs to return
						</br>
						</br><h2>		[제일이다] ULTIMATE</h2>
						</br>

						</br>
						<strong>Roars </strong>- has the highest Defense and HP
						</br>
						<strong>Airson</strong> - is the 1st member to gain a new gem & mode, Airson of Wind, with hidden stat for healing
						</br>
						<strong>GoldenAge</strong> - has the highest SkyWar statistic. This will make him a powerful striker in the future.

						</br>
						</br><h2>		[ 칠행 상생 ]  ELEMENTS </h2>
						</br>

						</br>	</br>
						<strong>Gem </strong>	- becomes immune to some moves
						</br>
						<strong>	Soul </strong> - absorbs and heals from some moves
						</br>
						<strong>	SkyWar  </strong>- can use LoreSongs to strike, with infinite distance and infinite combo 
						</br>
						<strong>	1 New Ult   </strong>- Gem Mode Ults can be played more than once every 4 turns, and create new ways to play LoreSongs
					</br>	</br>
						Example:
						</br>

						</br>
							The 2nd Boss, is weak to all moves from Airson of Wind.
						</br>
						</br><h1>		LEVEL 4</h1>
						</br>
						</br><h2>		[極鍍秘密 ] MYSTERY of the GLYPTIC</h2>
						</br>
							From the lore, the GLYPTIC is the belief that the member died for in their past lives - the belief that caused them to become only shadows trying to remember their past life.
						</br>
							The 極鍍 · 극도, ‘Geuk-Do’ in ancient Hanja means “extreme · metal adornment”. GLYPTIC means the art of carving a gemstone. 
						</br>
							GLYPTIC is a special power that creates an intricate ‘carving’ mechanism in the card game.

<h2> 
					
							<h2> [ 삼인 단체 ] TEAM</h2></br>
						</br>		고급 전략
						</br>	<strong>	!Beta Warning:</strong> these game mechanics are always being tested and developed - if you experience a bug, please contact MCsL staff!
					</br>	The game uses 3 members as 1 intricate machine, and allows “build paths” in each Boss battle
				</br>	<strong>	Order of Action & Stage Position: </strong>You can determine your 3 members’ order of action by highlighting them in any order 
			</br></br>	<h2> [ 4 전설 가요 ] PLAY</h2>
		</br>	<strong>Shone:Strike Power Calculation</strong> is based on member’s hidden Strength stat, with X and Roars leading in Strength. This stat can be boosted in the future by Glyptic carving
	</br>	<strong>Nyeve:Empire Power Calculation</strong> is based on current HP. Heal your members to full health to deal highest damage from Nyeve:Empire
</br><strong>	Nyeve MASSIVE Combo: </strong>GoldenAge can play a 2nd Nyeve: Empire, which deals extra damage. After that, subsequent Nyeve LoreSongs deal minimal damage
</br>	<strong>Healon:Calm Power Calculation </strong>is based on missing HP. The lower HP a member is, the stronger Healon:Calm becomes.
</br><strong>	Healon MASSIVE Combo:</strong> X can play a 2nd Healon:Calm, which deals extra damage.  After that, subsequent Healon LoreSongs deal minimal damage
</br><strong>Combo Defense</strong>: when defending, you can choose to not defend against the 1st Nyeve or Healon LoreSongs, and only against the 2nd to avoid the 4x damage
</br><strong>	Boss Manipulation by Healon: </strong>Healon can be played to get rid of Shone LoreSongs that Bosses might have. This makes the Boss less likely to attack you with Shone:Strike, important for high strength Bosses
							
</br></br>	
							<h2> [ 불멸의 정신 ] 4th Friend</h2>
						</br>	<strong>	Spirit Build:</strong> The 4th member who is left out teaches the entire team a global skill: Spirit. Spirit summons the 4th member whenever the team plays the 4th member's LoreSong.
					</br>	<strong>	Spirit Power Calculation:</strong> Spirit randomly strike an enemy; the power is boosted based on how many LoreSongs of the 4th member remains
				</br>		</br>		
							<h2> [제일이다] SECRET ULTIMATE</h2>

				The 4 members each have a secret ultimate that can charge up. !Each time a Secret Ultimate is launched, it consumes all the members' Secret Ultimate charges.
			</br>
			If you do not choose to use the light {Ult!} abilities, each member can launch a unique ultimate ability:
		</br>	</br>
		<strong>X</strong>: combines the 1st two elements of Ocean & Wind for a new ultimate. X charges up his Secret Ultimate each time a player is striked or healed to an even-number HP. When launched, X's Secret Ultimate strikes all enemies multiple times, including strikes for % HP. As an Ocean-Wind power, this is weakened by Blaze & StarEarth songs X holds. 
	</br>	</br>	<strong>GoldenAge</strong>: combines the elements of Thunder & Light for a new ultimate. GoldenAge gains a new LoreSong: Judgment, which strikes 1 target for massive damage, including % of the damage target has dealt. GoldenAge charges up his Secret Ultimate whenever a player on the field did not do any damage. As a Thunder-Light power, this is weakened by Eden songs GoldenAge holds. 
</br>	</br>		<strong>Roars</strong>: combines the elements of Blaze & StarEarth for a new ultimate. Roars charges up his Secret Ultimate each time Roars is damaged. When launched, Roars deals 3 random strikes, the third strike creating star-strikes that reflect off the remaining enemies. As a Blaze-StarEarth power, this is weakened by Ocean & Wind songs Roars holds. 
</br>	</br>	<strong>Airson</strong>: uses the last, mysterious element, Eden, for a new ultimate. Airson charges up his Secret Ultimate each time a player gains a LoreSong, or receives a gift of a LoreSong, or via Recycle: when players return a LoreSong beyond the LoreSong save limit. When launched, Airson strikes all enemies and heals all team members 7 times. As an Eden-elemental power, this power is not weakened but boosted by all other 6 elemental songs Airson holds. 
</br>	</br>In the Secret Script Hall, you can go to Script, Setting, Secret Ult Progress to toggle a mode that always notifies when you successfully charged a members Ultimate. 
			
					</br>		</br>	Win condition is to defeat the center Boss. To help you, Roars, Airson, GoldenAge, and X gains the following special abilities:
				</br><strong>EndGame:</strong> When you have defeated a piece (left or right) of the boss, each time a Secret Ultimate is launched, a following member will join right after to combo. For example, X follows GoldenAge, follows Airson, follows Roars, who follows back to X HeavenSea. 
			</br><strong>Critical Mode:	</strong>When a boss has both pieces (left and right) overcome, a low-HP member can enter Critical Mode, which allows them to quickly charge their Secret Ultimate!
		</br>	</br>	<h2> [ 칠행 상생 ] ELEMENTS</h2>
Based on the 오방색, the 7 elements, in order from {Origin} to {Mystery}, are: Ocean, Wind, Thunder, Light, StarEarth, Blaze, Eden. 
</br>The Eden elemental LoreSongs allows X to always win against his target when playing {X: The Mystery}, unless the target also plays an Eden LoreSong.

						</br>	<strong>		Immunity, Healing, and Weakness:</strong>  shifting elemental modes can grant a member immunity, heal, or strength against Bosses through elemental weakness
					</br>		<strong>	SkyWar Strike:</strong>  in new Gem Modes, Airson and Roars gain SkyWar. SkyWar can be played with infinite range and infinite combos, and take advantage of elemental weakness, immunity, and healing
							
				</br>		<strong>	SkyWar Defense:</strong>  when a SkyWar is launched, the two attacker and target take turns playing Shone:Strike back and forth. The player who can no longer counter with a Shone:Strike is damaged. This can be used to expend a Boss of Shone:Strikes. 
							
				

			</br>	<strong>	LoreSong Saving:</strong>  remember only 4 LoreSongs can be saved at the end of each turn - though GoldenAge and Airson can gift LoreSongs back and forth to escape this limit
							
		</br>		</br>		<h2> [ 세계 제일 ] WORLD RECORD!</h2>

	</br>If you play 5TORY 3VER 4FTER on a browser that does not clear storage, you
	can level-up your 4 characters!
</br>
	After the end of each battle, you gain Testaments from Ri. Enter the "Intro" 
	section for either Roars, Airson, GoldenAge, or X, to activate these Testaments to level up.
	Abilities become stronger, or, come with extra bonus strikes when leveled up. After all members 
	are level 50, their gold borders are revealed.
	</br>	</br>	In the secret Script Hall, these are additional scripts that can be helpful:
</br></br>	<strong>	1-Character Mode:</strong>  in Go, you can toggle "Full Team Mode" off to only have to focus on playing 1 character. The other 2 characters will be played by AI. You will always control the first character joined into a team.
</br>	<strong>	Turn Off Sparkles</strong> toggle this for small new animations during the game.
							
</br>	<strong>	Reporter Mode:</strong>  helps track every action taken. If you select Reporter mode, it also helps to display player damage beyond the screen on the right
						
							
</br>		</br>		<h2> [ 우리는 친구다 ] BETA: PLAY WITH FRIENDS</h2>
</br>		If you know how to establish a local server, you can start one to play with 2 other friends (3 players vs. 1 boss) in the beta testing multi-player
mode. If you would like to help staff test this mode, we are happy to contact you! <a href=" https://discord.gg/k2wanfRKAh" target="blank"> [link] </a>
